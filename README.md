# verse

Wordle-like game based on NYT's version. Has unlimited plays, a bot to compete against, variable word length, and more!

Word list originated from: [Linux Wordfile](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~ola/ap/linuxwords)
The word list was modified; capitalized words removed (proper nouns). Each was separated into their own category.

## Upcoming Changes

I would like to implement the following changes:

- A solving page. Would like to have a page that can find the word given clues.
- Hints mode. Gives hints like probabilities of next letter to narrow down more.
