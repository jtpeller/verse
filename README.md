# wordle
 Wordle-like game based on NYT's version. Has unlimited plays, a bot to compete against, variable word length, etc. 

 Word list originated from: [Linux Wordfile](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~ola/ap/linuxwords)
 The word list was modified; capitalized words removed (proper nouns). Each was separated into their own category.
 
## Upcoming Changes
 I would like to implement the following changes:
 - Call to action after winning/losing to restart the game
 - Animations
 - Implement a toast notification for when the user enters: duplicate guesses, guesses not in word list. Toast would also work to show a game status after winning (like "Congrats" or something)
 - Create a solving page. Would like to have a page that can find the word given clues.
 - Handicapped mode. Gives hints like probabilities of next letter to narrow down more.
 - Light/Dark mode functionality
 - AI modes. Easy mode (randomly guesses) to impossible mode (mixes strategies to get to the result nearly 100% of the time).
